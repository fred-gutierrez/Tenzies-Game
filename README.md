## Features
### Tenzies Game
- **Gameplay:** Tenzies is a dice game where the objective is to roll ten dice and get all of them to show the same number, preferably in the shortest time possible.
- **Dice Animation:** The game features animated dice rolls for an engaging and immersive gaming experience.
- **Game Tracker:** A game tracker keeps precise track of various statistics, including the current precise time, rolls per game, and the best time achieved in previous games.
- **Celebration Animation:** Upon successfully achieving Tenzies (all dice showing the same number), a celebration animation is triggered to reward the player for their accomplishment.

### React and Sass
- **React:** The game is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of interactive and dynamic game elements.
- **Sass:** Sass is used for styling the game, enabling the use of variables, nesting, and animations to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

### Project Showcase
The Tenzies Game is a showcase of programming skills and creativity, providing an entertaining and interactive experience. Whether you're a fan of dice games or simply interested in seeing how React and Sass can be used to create engaging web applications, this project offers an exciting demonstration of what's possible.
